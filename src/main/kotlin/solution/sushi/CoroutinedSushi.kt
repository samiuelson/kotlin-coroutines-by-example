/**
 *
 * Sushi Exercise.
 *
 * Steps to make sushi:
 * 1. Cook rice. It takes @see {VERY_LONG} time.
 * 2. Prepare vegetables. It takes @see {NOT_SO_LONG}
 * 3. Prepare fish. It takes @see {NOT_SO_LONG}
 * 4. Roll the sushi once the rice is ready. It takes @see {SHORT_TIME}
 *
 * Additional constraints:
 * Unfortunately you are have to go out in 8_000L millis to pickup children from school.
 * Make sure to cancel sushi job before going out.
 *
